Dear All,

I apologize for how delayed this email is. I would also like to submit an abstract for the DPG Fall meeting to talk about the DELight sensitivity studies, with a deadline of this Friday (June 20th). The abstract is actually just recycled from my Spring meeting talk. The title would be "The Projected Sensitivity of the DELight Experiment".


"There is vast unexplored parameter space for dark matter masses below a few GeV, and the field of direct dark matter detection is constantly expanding to new frontiers. In particular, low mass dark matter candidates necessitate novel detector designs with lower thresholds and alternative target materials compared to e.g. the xenon-based experiments currently providing the strongest overall constraints on many dark matter models.

The Direct search Experiment for Light dark matter (DELight) will deploy a target of superfluid 4He instrumented with large area microcalorimeters (LAMCALs) based on magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) technology in a setup optimized for low mass dark matter searches. In this talk an overview of this novel upcoming experiment will be presented, including preliminary background models and sensitivity projections."


Best Regards,
Eleanor Fascione
